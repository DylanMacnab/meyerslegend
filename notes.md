# TIL

1. You can create shorthand names for npm scripts or commands in the package.json. For example, 'npm start' will run 'node index.js';
2. The node modules folder is where all our dependencies are stored.
3. There is a require() module on the global level of npm that allows you to import npm modules into a file.
4. package-lock.json has a version for each dependency to align versions
